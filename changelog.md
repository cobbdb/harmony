# Change Log
All notable changes to Harmony will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Version 7

#### [7.7.0]
- Allow AdSlots to join multiple groups by using an array of group names in the
construction settings.

#### [7.6.0]
- Bind GPT events `slotOnload` and `slotVisibilityChanged` to slot-level event
handlers.

#### [7.5.0]
- Bind GPT events `slotOnload` and `slotVisibilityChanged` to system-level event
handler.
- Attach two new fields to GPT Slot instances `slot._name` and `slot._id` for use
during GPT events.
- `slot.name` is now soft deprecated. Scheduled for removal in version 8.

#### [7.4.2]
- Separate slot display from service enable to ensure srm bundles correctly.

#### [7.4.1]
- Ensure that repeat calls to `show` never results in double slot refresh.

#### [7.4.0]
- Expose wrapper for disableInitialLoad. This allows the option to restore
the page back to normal ad calls after the first (SRM usually) call has
returned. Double `show` call for SRM, then single `show` call afterwards.

#### [7.3.3]
- Reduce mangling of slot ids. Mangling will now only append "-h#" instead
of replacing the entire id.
- Added contributing guide to readme.

#### [7.2.0]
- New slot option `preserveId`. Disables container id mangling when `true`.
This will likely be inverted in Harmony 8 since disabling yields a
performance improvment.

#### [7.1.0]
- Expose master slot group as `harmony.slots`.

#### [7.0.2]
- `harmony.breakpoint()` now returns `undefined` when no
breakpoints have been set.

#### [7.0.1]
- Update breakpoint-watcher to use RequestAnimationFrame.
- Remove screen module in favor of `window.innerWidth`. IE9+.
- Stop mangling ad slot names. This forces developers to use
the grouping feature appropriately.
- Group slots together when refreshing with `show.group()`,
instead of refreshing one at a time.

## Version 6
#### [6.1.0]
- Expose system-level `impressionViewable` event.
- Attach slot name to GPT Slot object.

#### [6.0.0]
- Expose `slot.gpt` to decouple GPT slot from Harmony slot.
- Slot option `interstitial` changed to `outofpage`.
- Slots are no longer defined in GPT until they are displayed. This
is an effort to fix how Harmony behaves under Single Request Mode.
- Removed `hide.slot()` and `hide.group()` actions.
- Slot display styles are no longer altered by Harmony.
- Added support for ActiveView's impressionViewable event.
- Removed `harmony.hasSlot()`.
- Merged `harmony.show` and `harmony.refresh` into only `harmony.show`.
- Break up `harmony.load` into `load.targeting`, `load.slots`,
and `load.breakpoints`.

## Version 5
#### [5.0.2]
- Fixed bad NPM publishing credentials.

#### [5.0.1]
- Minor docs update.

#### [5.0.0]
- Mangle slot ids on slot creation always.
- Mangle slot names on creation for duplicates.
- Provide `googletag` by default.
- Enable GPT services on calls to `refresh()` and `show()`.

## Version 4
#### [4.1.0]
- Fully automated build process for docs and versioning.

#### [4.0.0]
- Remove global `Harmony()` constructor method.
- Expose API as a global object named `harmony`.
